            Hi, I'm Willian! I work as a front-end developer and one of
              the most challenging projects I have ever worked on was the
              development of an MVP of an app. I like to be up to date and be
              informed of the latest trends in the field so I'm very active on
              the dedicated communities on WhatsApp, Discord, and LinkedIn. I
              also keep an eye on technology news in Webnotici√°rios.  Along with my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
              React, I even have some understanding of Python and Linux. Apart
              from my academic and competitive programming experience, I am a
              lifelong learner and am continually seeking to expand my knowledge
              and skills in the world of  
front-end development.
